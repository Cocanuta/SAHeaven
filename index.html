        <h1>SAHeaven RP Development Blog</h1>

<p>SAHeaven Roleplay (SAH:RP) is a gamemode script written in PAWN for the multiplayer mod San Andreas Multi Player (SAMP). This is an all new game mode written by Ben Cherrington * with a major focus on Roleplay elements such as emotes, animations, jobs, food, houses, business, shops, inventory, government and more.</p>

<hr><h2>60c7e02</h2>

<p>I'm currently adding a full animation system that will flesh out the roleplay elements allowing players to perform a range of emotions.
Example:
<img src="/images/animation_sitting.jpg" alt="Animation_Sitting"></p>

<hr><h3>30/01/2013</h3>

<p>The development blog has been launched. This blog will be updated regularly as new features are added. The base of the gamemode is working, basic chat commands have been added, a login system, player data storage, position saving, and more.</p>
