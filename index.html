<p>SAHeaven Roleplay (SAH:RP) is a gamemode script written in PAWN for the multiplayer mod San Andreas Multi Player (SAMP). This is an all new game mode written by Ben Cherrington * with a major focus on Roleplay elements such as emotes, animations, jobs, food, houses, business, shops, inventory, government and more.</p>

<p>A working hunger system has been added, including a visual hunger bar located above the health bar on the players HUD. This system needs some work done to it, but it's a start. I've also added some more animations and completed the core of the animation system. This can now be used with any other command or action in the gamemode.</p>
<p>So far I have tied the act of eating a burger to the eating animation (seen in a screenshot below). The final function to be added today is the inventory system, although basic it allows for a great deal of improvement. Right now the players inventory is stored in a new file and the script simply looks for the item name to use it.</p>
<p>A basic weapons system has been added to this system that allows for a player to draw a weapon from their inventory and place it away again with ease. Food can also be consumed from the inventory which trigeres the animation I mentioned before.</p>
Here are some example screenshots of these systems in action.

<p>I'm currently adding a full animation system that will flesh out the roleplay elements allowing players to perform a range of emotions.
Example:

<p>The development blog has been launched. This blog will be updated regularly as new features are added. The base of the gamemode is working, basic chat commands have been added, a login system, player data storage, position saving, and more.</p>
